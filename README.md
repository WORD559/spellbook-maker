Procedurally generated spellbook sprites

This code was inspired by /u/ZenAnonymous's post on reddit, found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/8rm3sv/procedurally_generated_spellbook_spritestitles/)

I did not make the sprites, but copied them from the reddit post. If /u/ZenAnonymous wants these removed I will be removing them from the git history.
